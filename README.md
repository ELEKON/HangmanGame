# HangmanGame
This repository is about a Hangman Game creation. There is not a UI and the only way for someone to play with it, is to clone the code and run the project.
In order to play with your own list of words, the only thing you have to do, is to create one and place it on project. Also you have to change
the value of class variable WORDS_TXT_FILE which is located on HangmanGameConstants.java file and to initialize it with your file path!

Have fun!
